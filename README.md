**Project Description**
WhatINeedToDo is a full-stack application with separate frontend and backend directories (as seen in the repository) that allows users to create, view, update and delete tasks. The idea is simple: track what you need to do, mark when done, maybe categorize or prioritize tasks.
This project is ideal for learning and demonstrating skills in JavaScript, modern web stacks, API design, modular UI, and full-stack deployment.

**Features**
Create tasks with title, description, due-date and status (pending / completed).
View list of tasks; filter by status (all / pending / done).
Edit or delete tasks.
Backend API supporting CRUD operations.
Clean frontend UI (responsive) built with JavaScript library (Lucid-react, sooner) 
Project separated into frontend and backend for clear architecture.

**Technologies**
Frontend: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.
Backend: JavaScript (Node.js / Express).
Data storage: (You should note here what database you used, e.g., MongoDB, JSON file, etc.).
Tooling: npm / package.json for dependencies.

**Directory structure:**
/frontend  
/backend  
.gitignore  
package.json  
Languages: JS (~92.6 %), CSS (~6.7 %), HTML (~0.7 %) 

**GitHub Architecture & Structure**
frontend/ – the client-side application (UI, styling, user interactions).
backend/ – the server-side application (REST API, business logic, persistence).
At root: package.json, .gitignore, and other configuration files.
Clear separation of concerns: UI vs API, which supports maintainability and scaling.
